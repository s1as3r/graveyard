# Graveyard

A collection of small scripts/projects that I made while learning things.
Will probably be never touched again.

## Index

- [game-of-life](./game-of-life/)
  - Conway's Game of Life in rust.
- [pngme](./pngme/)
  - A DIY imtermediate rust project.
  - Encoding/Decoding messages into/from a PNG file.
- [hangman](./hangman/)

Other projects that i did but have repos of their own but belong in the "graveyard".

- [spotdl_cli](https://github.com/s1as3r/spotdl_cli) & [spotdl_gui](https://github.com/s1as3r/spotdl_GUI)
  - The first (kinda useful) scripts that i wrote. I had no idea of what i was doing.
  - Also, me at that time: pep8? what is that?
- [gospotdl](https://github.com/s1as3r/gospotdl)
  - The first project I did in a statically typed language.
  - [spotdl](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader) is way better, has many more features and is actually maintained.
- [skripts](https://github.com/s1as3r/skripts)
  - Some of the "skripts" belong here.
